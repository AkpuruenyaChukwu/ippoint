Ippoint is the front end for an app for creating and stratifying health appointments and reducing time spent by patients in waiting rooms.
Patient spend a lot of person-hours in waiting rooms of clinics.This can adversely affect their work, school, and lives.
Currently one patient can spend a whole day waiting for a few minutes appointment. The idea behind Ippoint is to cut down the waiting time of each patient bhy dividing patient into sections based on thier preffered time and other factors. That way, instead of arriving by 6AM alongside 10s of others to wait for your turn at about 2pm; some patients are scheduled for earlier and arrive earlier or scheduled for later and arrive later.
The aim is to create a system where patient's arrival is closer to their actual consultation therefore cutting down waiting time to about an hour.

This would be easier to adopt in hospitals utilizing EMR where scheduling and retrieving folders is automated. 

For Nigerian hospitals without electronic medical records, some of this waiting time is the time used to retrieve patient's folders. Such hospitals can create a system where patients can call in the day before or send text the day before to ask for their folders to be retrieved and to be assigned a time to arrive. When they then arrive dthey do not wait for folder retrieval but for their consultation to begin
